// ResourceName is the name identifying various resources in a ResourceList.
type ResourceName string

// Resource names must be not more than 63 characters, consisting of upper- or lower-case alphanumeric characters,
// with the -, _, and . characters allowed anywhere, except the first or last character.
// The default convention, matching that for annotations, is to use lower-case names, with dashes, rather than
// camel case, separating compound words.
// Fully-qualified resource typenames are constructed from a DNS-style subdomain, followed by a slash `/` and a name.
